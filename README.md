Bookmarklet to clip Kroger Coupons

### Summary
Its not always possible to know what you are going to buy for grocery before hand. This script is exactly comes to rescue.
kro-clipper is simple bookmarklet that you click when using Kroger site, to clip all* (150) coupons.

#### How to use:
1. Copy the source from bookmarklet.txt - https://github.com/nishnet2002/kro-clipper/blob/master/bookmarklet.txt
2. Create a bookmark in your favorite browser using that text.
3. Visit store website and login to your account. (Make sure you visit the FULL site and not mobile site.)
4. Click the bookmark you just created. (All the coupons will be automatically be added to your account and will be applied during checkout).


#### Shortcomings:
Currently Kroger allows only 150 Coupons at time. This is a problem because you might endup buying items not loaded.
As a workaround, clipper is configured to clip "relavant" coupons, so you would endup saving more.

Let me know, how this works for you, or any suggessions are welcome.
